## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Project Setup & Infrastructure
1. Initialize Git repository
2. Set up project structure
3. Configure Docker environment
4. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
5. Configure development environment

### Phase 2: Backend Development
1. Set up Django project with PostgreSQL
2. Implement user authentication system
3. Create core models:
   - Equipment
   - Calibration
   - Maintenance
   - User
   - Settings
4. Develop API endpoints
5. Implement data validation and business logic

### Phase 3: Frontend Development
1. Create responsive layout
2. Implement authentication pages
3. Develop dashboard components
4. Create equipment management interface
5. Build calibration tracking system
6. Implement maintenance scheduling
7. Create settings management page
8. Add audit report generation

### Phase 4: Testing & Quality Assurance
1. Write unit tests
2. Implement integration tests
3. Perform security testing
4. Conduct accessibility testing
5. Test responsive design
6. Performance optimization

### Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation
1. Create deployment documentation
2. Set up production environment
3. Configure monitoring
4. Create user documentation
5. Prepare deployment checklist

## Docker Strategy
We will implement a multi-stage build approach:
1. Development containers for local development
2. Production containers optimized for deployment
3. Separate containers for:
   - Django application
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Nginx (for serving static files)

## Volume Management
- `postgres_data`: Database persistence
- `app_settings_data`: Application settings and configurations
- `logs_data`: Application and system logs

## CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflow will include:
1. Code linting
2. Unit testing
3. Integration testing
4. Security scanning
5. Docker image building
6. Deployment to staging (if configured)

## Future Deployment Strategy
### Cloud Options
1. **Primary Recommendation**: DigitalOcean
   - Easy deployment
   - Good pricing
   - Simple scaling
   - Built-in monitoring

2. **Alternative Options**:
   - AWS (ECS + RDS)
   - Google Cloud (GKE + Cloud SQL)
   - Azure (AKS + Azure Database)

### Deployment Architecture
1. Load Balancer
2. Application Servers (2+ for redundancy)
3. Database Server (with backup)
4. CDN for static assets
5. Monitoring and logging stack
